PINXALA (pronouced as "pin-sa-la" and translated in english as "damage") is an application that is used to (1) collect exposure data and generate summary of vulnerabilities of a municipality/city, province or region, and (2) collect damage assessment report data which can be used in formulating post-damage and casualty impact report. Both functions supports geotagged pictures of the corresponding data submitted to a central server which consolidates and maps all records.
